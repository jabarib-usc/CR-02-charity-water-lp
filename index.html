        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Charity Water was founded in 2006 with a mission to bring clean and safe drinking water to people in developing countries. We believe that access to clean water is a fundamental human right, and we work tirelessly to make that a reality for everyone.

            Since our inception, we have funded over 60,000 water projects in 29 countries, providing clean water to over 11 million people. Our approach is transparent and efficient, ensuring that every dollar donated goes directly to funding water projects. We partner with local organizations to implement sustainable solutions that empower communities and create lasting change.
